# CLI Reference

Generated from the clap command tree by `cargo run --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml -- cli-reference`.
Do not edit by hand — a unit test fails when this file drifts from the binary.

Agents: `refine commands` emits this same tree as JSON; `refine next` recommends
which of these commands to run from current state.
